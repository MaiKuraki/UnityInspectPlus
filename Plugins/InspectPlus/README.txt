1. ABOUT
This plugin helps you view an object's Inspector in a separate tab/window, copy&paste the values of variables in the Inspector and inspect all variables of an object (including non-serializable and static variables) in an enhanced Debug mode.

2. HOW TO
- You can open the Inspect+ window in a number of ways: 
  1) right clicking an object in Project or Hierarchy windows
  2) right clicking an Object variable in the Inspector
  3) right clicking a component in the Inspector
- You can right click an object in the History list to add it to the Favorites list
- You can drag&drop objects to the History and Favorites lists to quickly fill these lists
- You can right click the icons of the History and Favorites lists to quickly select an object from these lists
- You can right click variables in the Inspector to copy&paste their values (variables that are not drawn with SerializedProperty don't support this feature)
- You can right click the Inspect+ tab to enable Debug mode: you can inspect all variables of an object in this mode, including static, readonly and non-serializable variables
- You can open Paste Bin via "Window/Inspect+/Paste Bin": this window lists the copied variables and is shared between all Unity projects (so, copying a value in Project A will make that value available in Project B). You can also right click variables/Components/Materials in the Inspector and select "Paste Values From Bin" to quickly pick a value from Paste Bin
- You can show the Inspect+ window from your editor scripts by calling the InspectPlusNamespace.InspectPlusWindow.Inspect functions
