# Unity Inspect+ Plugin

![screenshot](Images/screenshot.png)

This plugin helps you view an object's Inspector in a separate tab/window, copy&paste the values of variables in the Inspector and inspect all variables of an object (including non-serializable and static variables) in an enhanced Debug mode.

**[Support the Developer â˜•](https://yasirkula.itch.io/unity3d)**

## INSTALLATION

There are 4 ways to install this plugin:

- import [InspectPlus.unitypackage](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityInspectPlus/releases) via *Assets-Import Package*
- clone/[download](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityInspectPlus/archive/master.zip) this repository and move the *Plugins* folder to your Unity project's *Assets* folder
- *(via Package Manager)* add the following line to *Packages/manifest.json*:
  - `"com.yasirkula.inspectplus": "https://github.com/yasirkula/UnityInspectPlus.git",`
- *(via [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com))* after installing [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli), run the following command:
  - `openupm add com.yasirkula.inspectplus`

## HOW TO

- You can open the Inspect+ window in a number of ways: 
  - right clicking an object in *Project* or *Hierarchy* windows
  - right clicking an *Object* variable in the Inspector
  - right clicking a component in the Inspector
- You can right click an object in the **History** list to add it to the **Favorites** list
- You can drag&drop objects to the History and Favorites lists to quickly fill these lists
- You can right click the icons of the History and Favorites lists to quickly select an object from these lists
- You can right click variables in the Inspector to copy&paste their values (variables that are not drawn with *SerializedProperty* don't support this feature)
- You can right click the Inspect+ tab to enable **Debug mode**: you can inspect all variables of an object in this mode, including static, readonly and non-serializable variables
- You can open Paste Bin via **Window/Inspect+/Paste Bin**: this window lists the copied variables and is shared between all Unity projects (so, copying a value in Project A will make that value available in Project B). You can also right click variables/Components/Materials in the Inspector and select **Paste From Bin** to quickly pick a value from Paste Bin
- You can show the Inspect+ window from your editor scripts by calling the `InspectPlusNamespace.InspectPlusWindow.Inspect` functions
